# uARsafe
An Augmented Reality Application that educates people on different first aid practices like CPR, along with the usage of safety equipment like a fire extinguisher

## Reason behind its development:

- Accidents occur when the correct safety measures are not taken during emergency situations.
- Millions of dollars are spent on safety and first aid training imparted, 
  the cost of the same can be reduced dramatically with the use of augmented technology.

## Why an Augmented Reality solution?
- Augmented reality applications are cheaper and more efficient ways to enhance human
  safety. 
- The user simply needs to use an AR system which could be embedded into a
  supporting hardware like a smartphone.
- There is no prior safety knowledge that the individual should possess before making use of the system 
  as the application will train the user in safety practices right from the basics. 

## Literature Survey

- The project was conceived as the result of a review study on existing AR systems that pertain to safety and emergency training
